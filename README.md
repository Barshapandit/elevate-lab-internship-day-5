# 1st insight- Age and other variable counts are not same.This indicates Age has missing entries
# "Age" has 177 missing values and "Cabin" has 687 missing values and "Embarked" has 2 missing values.
#  Missing values of "Age" are replaced by mean values. "Age " is normally distributed.
# But The "Fare" is highly positively skewed
# "first class fare" is very much expensive.That's why most of the tickets booked are in the range of 0 to 50 dollars.
# This implies a negative correlation with "Pclass" and "Fare".
# no.of male passengers boarded are higher than female passengers.
# Highest no. of people "Embarked" at "S Point". This may happen that "S Point" is the starting point.
# As the "Fare" is positively skewed,a log transformation is done to make this normal distribution.
